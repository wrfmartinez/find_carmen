For today's morning lab, you'll be getting practice with the SQL commands you just learned.

_NOTE!_ To create a new postgres database without connecting to psql, in terminal bash just run `createdb [databasename]` where [databasename] is whatever you want to name your new database.

### Activity

1. Start by working in the `computers.sql` file and follow the directions outlined there
1. Move onto the `televisions.sql` file and follow the directions outlined there

##### :red_circle: How to run .sql files in terminal:

  - To run the .sql files, use the command: `psql database_name -f sql_file_name.sql`
      - For example: `psql <db_name> -f <path_to_file>`

### Hungry for More?

If you finish both files, try out the [realty lab](./realty)!
